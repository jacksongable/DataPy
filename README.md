# DataSnake
DataSnake is a Python script that performs statistical calculations based on user-inputted data. At the moment, DataSnake consists of a single class, OneVarStatsCalc. In order to use this utility, developers should pass a list of numbers to the class's constructor upon instantiation. Then, various bound methods can be invoked to perform calculations on the data. Please note the data set OneVarStatsCalc is initialized with is immutable.

As of now, the script does not contain any driver code. This will change in the future.
