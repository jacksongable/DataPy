# DataSnake
DataSnake is a Python script that performs statistical calculations based on user-inputted data. At the moment, it consists of a single class that performs one-variable statistics calculations along with some basic driver code.

In order to use this utility without the driver code, developers should pass a list of numbers to the class's constructor upon instantiation. Then, various bound methods can be invoked to perform calculations on the data. Please note the data set OneVarStatsCalc is initialized with is immutable.
